# CS112-Final
Our project is a music program that allows users to take a diagnostic test in order to see which type of genre of music they like. We also allow users to type in the name and  artist of a song and will play the song for them and show them the lyrics. Finally, for any  given song that the user inputs we will analyze its lyrics and classify it into a genre.
