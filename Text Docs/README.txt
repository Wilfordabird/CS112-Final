In order to run this project you will need a couple of things. 

These are:
1. All the files in the src folder

2. All of the .wav song files

3. JSOUP- I recommend grabbing it from https://jsoup.org/

4. Songs.txt

5. JAVAFX - I recommend grabbing it from https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/


Instructions:
To run this program, simply run MainSceneSwing.java. Read all instructions carefully and you should be good to go!

**In case of errors with user input on the Youtube Player and Lyrics Analysis, be sure that you are typing in only letters A-Z and numbers (1-9) (remove all other characters) and putting a space between any numbers and letters. 
For example, 5am in Toronto by Drake would be "5 am in toronto". Be sure that there are no extra spaces after your inputs. Finally, if a song does not seem to be returning lyrics, please check the 
exact title and artist name on www.genius.com and type it exactly as they do. Final note, sometimes the lyrics just don't show up and need another run!

** Do not try to run one path multiple times. In order to rerun a particular path, rerun the entire program. 

Thanks in advance and we hope you enjoy the project!
