== HIGH-LEVEL DESCRIPTION                                ==
==                                                       ==
== A few sentences describing your project. If your      ==
== project has changed since your proposal, please       ==
== address the elements you have added, changed or       ==
== removed.                                              ==
==                                                       ==
== What helpful advice or feedback did you get from      ==
== your milestone meeting this week. Has this impacted   ==
== your plans for finishing up the project?              ==
===========================================================

Our project will be a music program that allows users to take a diagnostic test in order
to see which type of genre of music they like. We also allow users to type in the name and 
artist of a song and will play the song for them and show them the lyrics. Finally, for each 
song that the user inputs, we will try and classify it into a genre based on its lyrics. 

In our milestone meeting, Reese gave us some resources to use to get started with Swing and 
some of the other aspects of our project that were very helpful. He mentioned that youtube might
be hard to use so we changed our plans accordingly. 

===========================================================
== CODE-LEVEL DESCRIPTION                                ==
==                                                       ==
== Recall the code-level description you gave in the     ==
== proposal. Describe the parts you have completed and   ==
== list the ones you are still working on.               ==
===========================================================

Complete:
The diagnostic test portion is complete. It can be run from our main scene program using a button listener. 

The project also uses a program named JSOUP to scrape date from genius.com in order to provide
lyrics to analyze. It then passes this onto a genre analysis that gives an estimate to the
genre of the lyrics provided using our patented formula. This import part of the music both displays lyrics
for the user and plays the song from youtube. 

Moreover, the program utilizes a webbrowser in the background of our jframes in order to search
youtube for the song given by the user. This in conjunction with the genius bit adds a cool
web dynamic to the project.

TODO: 
- Creating the genre analysis based on lyrics. We hope it will be accurate (no promises)

===========================================================
== DESIGN/IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES                      ==
==                                                       ==
== What challenges have you encountered while working    ==
== on the project so far?                                ==
== How did you overcome them or are you still working    ==
== on solving them?                                      ==
===========================================================

-playing YouTube audio: We put a webbrowser in the background of the program and made it invisible for the illusion of mp3 streaming
-Playing audio with play/pause: Used a JDK media player to play .wav files
-finding songs through Genius: Used JSOUP to scrape the HTML for the lyrics, 
-finding videoId from scraped HTML from youtube page: Turned HTML document into txt file. Got a string from txt file based on keyword. Sorted through string to return video ID.

The jury is still out on:

- A problem we're still having is how to automatically close a panel after a new page is opened. 
- We're also still working to categorize songs based on the lyrics we get from Song.java

===========================================================
== TEAM PLANNING                                         ==
==                                                       ==
== How many hours has your group spent on the project    ==
== so far? How many hours do you estimate remain to      ==
== complete your goals for the project? These numbers    ==
== do not impact your grade, but are very helpful for    ==
== us to know, so please answer honestly.                ==
===========================================================

I would estimate that our group this far in the project has spent 40 hours. The remaining hours that we estimate it will 
take in order to finish all our goals would be 5 to 10 hours.
